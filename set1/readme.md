TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Lots to take in, frustrating install process, but I'm taking things in. I think I'll be challenged quite significantly with this course, but I think I have a good coding mindset head start because I played around with some basic coding computer programs as a kid. Stuff like this makes sense to me logically, but I will definitely need to practice to be able to do it at speed.
