TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I have completed all the sets now, and while I still feel completely lost, I think I have a better understanding of the basics of coding. I definitely could not code anything special, but I can think like coder, at least somewhat. I'd say that's a win.

As for my data project, I'm feeling pretty lost, but I have a dataset and I think I can work with it. I'll continue to use chatGPT and online resources.
