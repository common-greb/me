TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I don't know if I could do this class without chatGPT. I still don't want to be relying on it, but using it to help me understand. It still hurts my head, frustrates me, and is very satisfying when it works. I don't think I can do coding long term, I think I'll change my minor to something different from computational design.
