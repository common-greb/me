TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Again, not in order. Sorry.
I'm realizing coding might not be for me. I'm so confused, but I'm getting through it. I'm finding Chat GPT is teaching me better than the official resources for this class, so that's good. Keen to just get this done.
