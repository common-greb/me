TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I'm not doing this in order, as I didn't know how this class was structured. On that, I am completely confused by the structure of this course. Like, what's going on? Moodle has inaccurate information, sometimes we're using teams, the design-computing website shows things for the wrong weeks. I'm pretty lost, but I'm keen to just be done!
