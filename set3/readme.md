TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
For some reason, this was a bit of fun. I used a little bit of ChatGPT to help understand some concepts, but I tried not to rely on it. 
I think I'm slowly developing my coding muscles, and I'm beginning to really enjoy the problem solving element. I still find the work very difficult, and usually quite frustrating, but if I'm at home, going at my own pace, I find it manageable. I also got some help from my brother who is a big coding nerd.

At this point I have not done exercise 4. I'll definitely need to watch the lecture and do some research for that one, it looks pretty intimidating.
