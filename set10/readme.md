TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Here's my reflection on the class as a whole:

I decided to take this class because I took my time when selecting my timetable, and all the electives I was keen on were full.

I was kind of keen to learn coding, once I was here. I found the lectures interesting, but the tutorials were incredibly painful. I felt stupid, humiliated, and so behind. Literally hurt my head. But when I did figure something out, I was quite satisfied. I can see the appeal of coding, and now I feel like I have developed a bit of a coding mindset. I'm by no means an expert, but I feel like I could confidently figure out a coding task if it came up in my future Industrial Design studies. I'd say that's a win.

I still haven't made a good start on my data project. And at this point, I'm not too attached to it. If I could pass the class without even doing it, I might skip the whole assignment to prioritize the classes that I am more passionate about it. But, because I have a little bit of integrity, I plan to attempt it this week. I have 2 more massive assignments due that day, and this one is my last priority. So we'll see.
