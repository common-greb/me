TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

"""The end of "exercise2.py" prints "MC Hammer"
I'm running behind on this class. I've been putting off the work, because I'm pretty scared of it. During tutorials I feel very lost, which makes me feel pretty terrible about my coding ability. I find it hard to ask my peers questions, because they are usually so far ahead of me.

But, when I sit down at my desk at home, plug in my big monitor, and give it some time, things eventually make sense. I think I learn better on my own in this class, because I can take things at my own pace and not feel the classroom environment pressure.

I've been feeling like I won't be able to pass this class, which hasn't been great on my mental health. But, when I do understand something, it is a really nice feeling. I like the problem solving aspect of coding, but it can be very frustrating before I come up with anything

ChatGPT is a wonderful tool. I'm trying not to rely on it, but use it as a learning aid. It's pretty great at showing me how stuff works."""
